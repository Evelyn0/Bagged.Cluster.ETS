# Bagged.Cluster.ETS
Method developed by Tiago Dantas and Fernando Cyrino Oliveira that combines Bagging, Clusters and ETS to produce highly accurate forecast.

- The Paper called "**Improving Time Series Forecasting: an Approach Combining Bootstrap Aggregation, Clusters and Exponential Smoothing**" describing the entire approach has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Forecasting.

- As an extension of the work of Christoph Bergmeir, Rob Hyndman and José Benítez, this code uses parts of the BaggedETS R function from the **forecast** package.
